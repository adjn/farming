# Potatoes
## Timelines
- Start prepping in late Winter. Nursery's typically get their first seed potatoes from the end of January through February. 
- Planting should occur after last frost. 
- Harvest in fall, after the leaves have died back. 

## Bucket method
Note: These instructions are for 10 gallon buckets, adjust as necessary for your situation

### Supplies
- Seed potatoes (2 seed potatoes per 10 gal)
- High quality soil (e.g. compost, potting soil)
- 10+ gal growing buckets (e.g. felt grow buckets, plastic buckets with holes for drainage at the bottom)

**Recommended:**
- Gardening/assembly gloves
- Small shovel / trowel 
- Vermiculite or coconut coir
- Fertilizer (two options):
  - High nitrogen fertilizer - High N. (e.g. bone meal) &
  - High phosphorus fertilizer - High P.  
    \- OR \-
  - Balanced fertilizer (5-10-10)
- Tarp, wheelbarrow, or other space/means to empty the buckets

**Optional:**
- Chicken wire screen
- Straw mulch  

### Preparation 
Begin preparation 2-4 weeks before last frost

0. Larger seed potatoes can be split in two. The target size is roughly a large chicken egg. Allow cut edges to fully dry (~2 days). 
1. Sit the seed potatoes in a window sil, with any stronger buds pointing up. 
    - An egg carton with the lid removed works well. 
2. Wait for 2 or 3 strong buds to develop, then remove the remaining buds and undeveloped eyes (Fewer stems will result in fewer, larger tubers)
3. Once the buds are well developed and last frost has passed, begin planting


### Planting

0. Decide on your soil:
    - Using straight compost is viable, though not recommended as it came become quite dense and more difficult to harvest from
    - Preferred alternatives include top soil, potting soil, or a mix including compost with potting soil and/or coconut coir 
    - Vermiculite can also be added, potentially unnecessary if using coconut coir
1. Set the bucket out on a flat surface that can get dirty (e.g. lawn). 
2. Add your soil, filling the bottom third.  
    **Recommended:** Add the High N. fertilizer and mix in to the top inch.
3. Make two small divots in the soil on opposite sides, about 1/3 of the way in from the edge. 
4. Gently place two seed potatoes, buds pointing up in the divots
5. Carefully add soil in and around the seed potatoes; taking special care to avoid damaging the buds. 
6. Once the bucket is full of soil, mix in additional High N. fertilizer into the top inch and water in. 


### Maintaining

#### Watering
- Check daily or every other day, depending on the weather
- Observer that the soil past the first inch is damp. Water if not. 
- Do not over water. Soil should be damp, not soaked. 

#### Fertilizing
Once you notice flowers, add High P. fertilizer and mix it in to the top layer of the soil. Water in.

Note: If you are NOT planning to collect potato berries to work on True Potato Seed potatoes, you can remove the flowers or any potato berries you find. Potato berries are poisonous; do not eat them. 

#### Slug control
- There are chemicals that can be used to control slugs. Iron phosphate has seen mixed success. Beer traps sometimes work well. 
- Also consider waking up early (or between first and second sleep [[1](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20220107-the-lost-medieval-habit-of-biphasic-sleep)][[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyphasic_sleep)]) and going outside to clear any slugs. They will sometimes hide under the buckets during the day as well.

#### Surface breakthroughs
Later in the season you may notice tubers breakthrough the surface of the soil. Be sure to cover that as potatoes exposed to sunlight can generate a poisonous substance. 

### Harvesting 
0. Find an appropriate location to empty the buckets. This could be any number of things including onto a tarp, into a wheelbarrow, or into a raised bed that needs some additional soil.  
    **Optional:** Use a chicken wire screen nailed to a 2x4 frame to dump the buckets onto.  
1. One bucket at a time empty and sort though the potato buckets
2. Brush off all loose dirt from the potatoes, but do no wash them off. 
3. Lay them out flat, in a lightless room for a ~2 weeeks for the skins to dry
4. Store in a cold, humid, and dark space; think root cellar. 
5. Check on the potatoes monthly and knockoff any sprouting eyes


### Future consideration
- A structure to support the leaves/steams as they are weak. 
- Other snail/slug defense
